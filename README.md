A simple command-line **Python quiz application** built using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles. Developed as part of my **#90DaysOfCode** challenge, this project focuses on clean code structure, modular design, and practicing core Python concepts such as classes, loops, conditionals, and user input handling.
